Raindrops Game
===============

A raindrop will fall from the top of the screen and will continue to fall 
again unless stopped by the catcher. The catcher will cause the 
raindrop to stop, the score to increase, and the raindrop to disappear. 
Eventually, it will be modified where the player can lose if a raindrop
manages to fall to the ground. 

Raindrops Steps
===============

Create a Raindrops Class

Create a Catcher Class

Create a Poison Class

Make a CheckCatcher Function in Catcher class so when
the catcher intersects with both types of raindrops, it will stop.

After a raindrop is caught, the score will increase by 2 but if 
a poisonous (green) raindrop is caught, the score will decrease by 3.

If the raindrop is caught, the raindrops will disappear.
