__Raindrops Game__

A raindrop will fall from the top of the screen and will continue to fall 
again unless stopped by the catcher. The catcher will cause the 
raindrop to stop, the score to increase, and the raindrop to disappear. 
Eventually, it will be modified where the player can lose if a raindrop
manages to fall to the ground. 

__Raindrops Steps__

Create a Raindrops Class

Create a Catcher Class

Make a CheckCatcher Function in Raindrops class so when
the catcher intersects with the raindrops, it will stop.

After a raindrop is stopped, the score will increase.

If the raindrop is caught, the raindrops will disappear.
